# Open Jupyter notebook 

Make sure that you open Jupyter notebook at the same location you want your data to reside.



STEP 1. Start Jupyter Notebook

Anaconda prompt -> Direct to location -> Start Jupyter Notebook

STEP 2: Open new notebook in the location

### Edit mode

Edit mode is indicated by a green cell border and a prompt showing in the editor area:

When a cell is in edit mode, you can type into the cell, like a normal text editor.

Enter edit mode by pressing `Enter` or using the mouse to click on a cell's editor area.

### Command mode

Command mode is indicated by a grey cell border with a blue left margin:

The most important keyboard shortcuts are `Enter`, which enters edit mode, and `Esc`, which enters command mode.

In edit mode, most of the keyboard is dedicated to typing into the  cell's editor. Thus, in edit mode there are relatively few shortcuts.   In command mode, the entire keyboard is available for shortcuts, so  there are many more.  The `Help`->`Keyboard Shortcuts` dialog lists the available shortcuts.

We recommend learning the command mode shortcuts in the following rough order:

1. Basic navigation: `enter`, `shift-enter`, `up/k`, `down/j`
2. Saving the notebook: `s`
3. Change Cell types: `y`, `m`, `1-6`, `t`
4. Cell creation: `a`, `b`
5. Cell editing: `x`, `c`, `v`, `d`, `z`
6. Kernel operations: `i`, `0` (press twice)
